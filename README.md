# Unity3D Super Metroid

Unity3D Super Metroid is an open-source Unity3D implementation of the SNES Super Metroid game, one of my favorite games.

## Status
The project contains a fully functional scene, the first scene in the game. All movements of
Samus are implemented, sounds included. Sprites used were carefully extracted from the original game and from some assets shared in the community.

Some demo videos available at my facebook page. [JUMIT LABS](https://www.facebook.com/jumitlabs/videos/1712616409014841/)
